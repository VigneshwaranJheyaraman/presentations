# History

* `neovim` is a flavour of [`vim` editor](https://www.vim.org/) which is the OG text editor
that revolutionized text based editing with more supportive functionalities

* `vim`  was created by **Bram Moolenaar** which was forked from the **Bill Joy's** `vi` editor

* `vi` editor was plain screen-based editor which allow writing and reading files

* `neovim` on the other hand is the fork of `vim` with much more batteries (_builtin functionalities_)
included to enable current technologies intergration more efficiently

* `vim` and `vi` are natively found on your `Linux` based systems starting from BusyBox, 
mostly our `linux-servers` we have have these `vim` preinstall except for lighter images like `alpine` etc.,
